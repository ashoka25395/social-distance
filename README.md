# social-distance

**I have created the restFulWebService for social distance.I have written 5 REST APIs:**
.createProfile
.addUserFriend
.removeUserFriend
.viewFriendList
.findConnectionsAtDistanceK

All the apis are simple except last one where i use BFS(Breadth First Search).First time my competitve coding part come into practice i enjoyed writing this last api.

Instructions to run the application:
This is spring boot project with maven dependecies.You can import the project in spring boot and you just need to run **mvn clean spring-boot:run** command to run the project.
